            <span className="font-bold text-base">2.1 Refund Process:</span> Once we receive your returned item, we will inspect it and notify you of the status of your refund. If your return is approved, we will process a refund to your original method of payment within 7-10 business days.

            <span className="font-bold text-base">2.2 Partial Refunds:</span> In certain situations, only partial refunds may be granted (e.g., if the item is not in its original condition, is damaged, or is missing parts for reasons not due to our error).

            - Gift cards<br/>
